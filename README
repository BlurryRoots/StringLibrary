# Yet another string object implementation in C

# Getting started

My naive approach of implementing a small library to work with object like strings in C.

Clone the repository with '''git clone --recursive https://github.com/BlurryRoots/StringLibrary''', to fetch the sources as well as the [Catch library]() for building the tests.

Build the library via makefile. Typing '''make''' will build the library as well
as running all the tests.

## Usage

For examples on how to use the library, see test files. Further API documentation
may come at some time in the future.

## Todo

Use CMake for build management.
